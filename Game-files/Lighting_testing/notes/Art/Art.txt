obtained using AI art generation
https://creator.nightcafe.studio/studio?open=creation&panelContext=%28jobId%3AycaqsOoNm0vOpHIro369%29
this is the link to the site in which we used
The prompt was "apocolyptic city with desolate environment with cars and buildings with viewpoint from the road looking through the city"
spr_winning
	-also used AI art generation and used prompt similar to 
winning apolcaplyse and leaving a city office building with main character leaving off into the sunset
	-Other spr that were created from AI was background for the death seq
human spider hybrid with more human less spider
(This was needed as they just either gave all human or all spider and did not merge them)
	-sounds I do not have the licensing information but I'm pretty sure they were create by Bryan the other member of my group I will have to double check tho from what
I was told it's all original work
	-The coding was worked in from other projects like the simple platformer to look at the irandom code and path systems
	-I used some of the gamemaker tutorials to either enhance the code I already created or to learn how to implement something like the pause GUI and start page of the
game with working buttons working on a sequence GUI layer as I did not know how to mesh these things

For the office sprites this message was written in the file Titled "LICENSES"
